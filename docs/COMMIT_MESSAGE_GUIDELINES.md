# Commit Message Guidelines

This project uses [Commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/), and Conventional Commitlint to make great commit messages.

Please do not disable those features without the approval of the team.

You can skip those interactions by:

```git
git commit --no-verify
```
